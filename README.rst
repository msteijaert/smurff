What is Bayesian Matrix Factorization
-------------------------------------

Matrix factorization is a common machine learning technique for
recommender systems, like books for Amazon or movies for Netflix.

The idea of these methods is to approximate the user-movie rating matrix
R as a product of two low-rank matrices U and V such that R ≈ U × V . In
this way U and V are constructed from the known ratings in R, which is
usually very sparsely filled. The recommendations can be made from the
approximation U × V which is dense. If M × N is the dimension of R then
U and V will have dimensions M × K and N × K.

Bayesian probabilistic matrix factorization (BPMF) has been proven to be
more robust to data-overfitting compared to non-Bayesian matrix
factorization.

What is SMURFF
--------------

SMURFF is a highly optimized and parallelized framework for Bayesian
Matrix and Tensors Factorization. SMURFF supports multiple matrix
factorization methods:

* `BPMF <https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~amnih/papers/bpmf.pdf>`__, the basic
  version;
* `Macau <https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.04610>`__, adding support
  for high-dimensional side information to the factorization;
* `GFA <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.5799.pdf>`__, doing Group Factor
  Anaysis.

Macau and BPMF can also perform **tensor** factorization.
